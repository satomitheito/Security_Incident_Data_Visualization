        <p>The map reveals where aid work is most dangerous. However, the map alone will not answer everything. It doesn't tell us who is being targeted. It doesn't show how attacks happen and it doesn't explain why some workers are more vulnerable than others. That's what we'll look at next.</p>

        <p>Not all aid workers face the same dangers.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Over the past two decades, the number of national staff affected by security incidents has surged, reaching over 700 in 2024. In contrast, the number of international staff affected has remained relatively low and stable. Local aid workers are often the first to arrive and the last to leave. They're embedded in the communities they serve, navigating terrain where violence is unpredictable and protection is limited.</p>

        <p>Across nearly every country, men make up the majority of recorded victims. In places like Afghanistan, South Sudan, and Somalia, there are high male counts, followed by unknown, then female.</p>
        <br>
        <p>That doesn't mean women aren't affected. It could potentially means they might not be seen. Gender is often missing in incident reports. Victims are listed as "unknown" or not at all.</p>

          Every incident in this dataset is described in just a few words. But across thousands of cases, a pattern emerges. The most common terms paint a familiar picture: “staff,” “killed,” “national,” “shot". Others point to where the danger often begins: “convoy,” “vehicle,” “road,” “ambushed,” “traveling".
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Again and again, violence finds aid workers not just in camps or compounds, but in transit.

        <br>
        <p>
          These aren't just words. They’re clues about where vulnerability lives.
